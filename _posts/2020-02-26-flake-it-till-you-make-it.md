Today marks the culmination of my 12th year as a quadriplegic. On an occasion like this, it would be great to offer some profound words of enlightenment, but there’s nothing to say that hasn’t been said at some point in the past. Perhaps just a reminder that living with paralysis is a continuous education.

The other day I found myself outside on my patio, basking in the warmth of the sun (something I have come to appreciate more than I ever thought possible). Listening to the radio as the sun warmed my face, I was aware of how fortunate I was to have this moment. No sooner had that appreciation been realized than a gust of wind seemingly came out of nowhere. The breeze, while a comfortable respite amidst the sun’s radiance, knocked over my tomato plant with no regard for my situation.

In that beautiful moment, I was reminded of how helpless I was. I watched as the soil spilled from the pot across the concrete. There was nothing I could do to remedy the situation. After a few moments of gazing upon my fallen shrub, I repositioned my wheelchair into the sunlight, closed my eyes, and resumed my appreciation of the sun’s warmth.

Moments like that encapsulate what these past 12 years have been like. At times, beautiful and wonderful, precious moments that instill gratitude and appreciation. And then without warning, there are moments of helplessness and despair, instances that deliver an instant buzzkill. It’s an unpredictable pendulum that I am constantly learning to navigate.

We all deal with these pendulum swings throughout our lives. The important thing is that we continue to learn from every swing. I continue to learn every day. I learn what my limits are; I learn what my body’s idiosyncrasies mean; I learn how hard good help is to come by, and how appreciative I am for the fantastic help I do have.

After 12 years of living with paralysis, I’m still not comfortable with it, but I continue to learn how to live with it.

After 12 years of living with paralysis, I’m still grateful that I get to wake up every day – even when I have to deal with pendulum swings. It’s a lot better than the alternative.

After 12 years of living with paralysis, I’m still humbled by the sacrifices my family makes, the support my friends offer, and the opportunities God bestows upon me.

And after 12 years of living with paralysis, I’m still excited to celebrate Independence Day.

Wishing everyone a healthy and safe Fourth of July! Forever grateful for the continued support!

Stand Strong!
